## Todo

- [ ] Restructure to generalise over the types of hardware we talk to,
      instead of hard-coding SQ and FaderPort.
      Should implement modules in JSON, including the following:
  - [ ] FaderPort (1, 8, 16)
  - [ ] SQ (5, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Mackie Control Universal (and HUI?)
  - [ ] Other generic MIDI specifications? (e.g. General MIDI)
